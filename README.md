# Automated Client Onboarding Process with Make.com

This document outlines the steps we took to automate a client onboarding process using Make.com, Google Forms, a CRM (e.g., HubSpot or Salesforce), and an email marketing service (e.g., Mailchimp or SendGrid). This automation allows us to seamlessly collect client information, create new client records in our CRM, and send personalized welcome emails.

## Overview of the Process

Our automation workflow consists of three main steps:
1. **Google Form Submission**: Collect client information using a Google Form.
2. **Create a New Client Record in CRM**: Automatically add a new client record in the CRM based on the form responses.
3. **Send a Personalized Welcome Email**: Use an email marketing service to send a welcome email to the new client.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

#### 1. Google Form Creation

We started by creating a Google Form to collect client information. This form includes fields like **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Email Address**, **Company Name**, and **Service Interested In**. The form serves as the entry point for new client data.

#### 2. Connecting Google Form to Make.com

Next, we connected the Google Form to Make.com to trigger actions whenever a new form response is submitted. We set up Make.com to monitor the Google Form for new responses using the **"Watch Responses"** trigger. This step ensures that each time a new client fills out the form, Make.com initiates the automation process.

#### 3. Creating a New Client Record in the CRM

After establishing the trigger from the Google Form, we added a module in Make.com to create a new client record in our CRM (such as HubSpot or Salesforce). For this step, we used the **"Create a New Contact"** action in the CRM module. We mapped the fields from the Google Form responses (like First Name, Last Name, Email, and Company Name) to the corresponding fields in the CRM. This setup allows us to automatically add new clients to our CRM without manual input, reducing errors and saving time.

#### 4. Sending a Personalized Welcome Email

To enhance the onboarding experience, we added a step to automatically send a personalized welcome email to each new client. We integrated an email marketing service (Mailchimp or SendGrid) with Make.com. Using the **"Send an Email"** action, we configured the email to include dynamic fields like the client's first name and company name. The email is triggered to send once the new client record is created in the CRM, providing a seamless and timely welcome to our services.

#### 5. Testing the Automation Workflow

After setting up the automation steps, we thoroughly tested the entire workflow to ensure everything worked as expected. We submitted a test response through the Google Form to check if the new client record was correctly created in the CRM and if the welcome email was sent to the clientâ€™s email address. This testing phase allowed us to identify and fix any issues or errors in the workflow.

#### 6. Activating the Scenario

Once testing was successfully completed and all components were verified to be working correctly, we activated the scenario in Make.com. Activating the scenario means the automation is now live and will continuously run, automatically processing new client submissions from the Google Form as they come in.

### Conclusion

With these steps, we have successfully automated the client onboarding process, significantly reducing the manual effort required and ensuring a consistent and professional approach to welcoming new clients. The automation not only saves time but also minimizes the risk of errors and enhances client engagement from the outset.

### Potential Enhancements

- **Add Follow-Up Emails**: Automate follow-up emails after a set period to further engage with the client.
- **Integrate Additional CRM Features**: Consider integrating additional CRM features, such as tagging or segmenting clients based on their responses.
- **Analytics and Reporting**: Add modules to track the performance of the onboarding process, such as open rates of the welcome email or client engagement metrics.
